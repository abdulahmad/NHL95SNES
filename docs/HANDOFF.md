# Handoff

## State (2026-10-31)

- Full build MATCH (SHA-1 `0b939f267377801d2c805b05c06a7ee6c880c5fc`, 1,048,576 bytes); `tools/verify_all.sh` MATCH (full build and
  all 256 segments built on their own from their stubs).
- bankC0_0000 is source (data only, $C00000-$C00F48): TeamPalettes, ArrowFontTiles, GradientBarTiles, MeterFontTiles (packed),
  UnusedPalette, SoundRAMClear (SPC700). The other segments are incbin; `CartHeader` in `src/bankC0_F000.asm` is source.
- Next: segment bankC0_1000, org moved to $C00F49 (see `SEGMENT_AGENT.md`, `PROMPT.md`). Onboarding: McMarkis.

## Notes for the next segments

- Code runs in banks $C0-$CF (reset `jml $C580C6`, NMI `jml $C08B45`), mostly with DB = $80. The engine is not the 94S engine: the
  unpacker, the transfer queues and the sound driver are different code, so 94S names need a purpose match, not a code match.
- Packed data: `lda #addr / ldx #bank / jsl $C581E1` unpacks to [$2C] ($C581D7 sets [$2C] = $7E:50DC first; $C58A65 unpacks a
  $1000 buffer and queues it for VRAM at Y). Header: size word, format word (0, 2, 4, 6, 8: the jump table at $C58219), stream.
  `python3 tools/unpack95.py lst/nhl95snes.sfc ADDR...` (a model of the five formats; format 8 not yet seen) gives the exact
  end and checks the size; keep the stream as a ROM cut after `dw size, format`.
- Transfer queues are separate stacks: $00 VRAM, $04 CGRAM (the $C4CC5x loop writes CGADD and DMAs to CGDATA). A record is
  pushed as size, destination, bank, source while $06 is decremented (busy).
- Sound: $CF001A sends SoundRAMClear ($C00F05), then the sound driver upload blocks at $C00F49 (SMSG 3.07w Jason Andersen / John
  Schappert 8/17/1994: $D8 bytes at sound RAM $1000, $0A0C bytes at $0120, start $1000) through the IPL upload routine at
  $CF004B (94S calls the same job SPCUpload; 94S SoundDriver is the program it sends). bankC0_1000 starts with those blocks.

## Setup notes

- asar 1.91 on PATH or in `tools/bin/` (`tools/setup.sh`). Python 3.
- ROM at `lst/nhl95snes.sfc` (committed for now, temporary). `Extracted/` and `output/` are generated and gitignored.
- `python3 tools/disasm65816.py lst/nhl95snes.sfc output/quickpass` is the quick-pass disassembler (NHL94SNES's, ported to HiROM).
  It starts at the vectors only; reset and NMI soon reach indirect jumps (`jml [$04AA]`) and inline-parameter calls, so add
  `--entry ADDR:M:X` for the routines you work on. It also writes `xref.txt` (every long operand into the ROM).
- Windows: `python3` must be a real Python (not the Store alias). `tools/verify_segment.sh` normalises the asar path, because
  Windows cannot start a relative program path written with forward slashes.

## Unsure

- ArrowFontTiles and MeterFontTiles are named from their rendered tiles; the screens that load them (VRAM $4A00 from $C5521E,
  VRAM $4800 from $C521EB / $C55826) are not traced, so neither is matched to a 94S font (SmallFontTiles, BigFontTiles) yet.
- GradientBarTiles: rendered bars; where they are drawn (VRAM $0640 from $C4D864, $0010 from $C59119) is not traced.
- UnusedPalette: no operand or pointer in the ROM is $0EE5; a computed address could still reach it.
